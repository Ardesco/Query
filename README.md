A query object designed to make page objects easier to manage

##Â How do I get started?

It's simple to start with, just create a basic query object in your page object:

    Query query = newQuery(By.id("foo");
    
Do you want to have different locators for different browsers?  Once you have set the default locatir you can add overrides for different browsers:

    query.addAlternateLocator(BrowserType.GOOGLECHROME, By.id("bar");
    query.addAlternateLocator("custom_driver", By.id("custom");
    
Once you have set custom locators the query object will check the desired capabilities of the current instantiated driver and just use the appropriate locator    
    
## OK, I have a query object. Now what?    

It's designed to return certain element types that you can use in yoru page objects, the various types are shown below:

    WebElement element = query.findWebElement();
    List<WebElement> elementList = query.findWebElements();
    Select selectElement = query.findSelectElement();
    
Ok, that's kind of useful, anything else?

Have you ever got frustrated trying to get locators out of element to use in expected conditions?  No longer a problem:

    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 15, 100);
    wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(query.locator));
    
Thats all for now, if you can think of any useful additions just raise an issue.
